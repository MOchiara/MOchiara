# Hi! It's me Chiara

Mountain lover at heart, oceanographer by passion, and proud glider mom by day (and pretty much at night too)

* :ocean: I manage the gliders fleet for the [Experimental Oceanography group at the University of Hamburg](https://eleanorfrajka.com/)
* :new: Newbie to the moorings world, but excited to learn and slowly finding my way
* :speech_balloon:  Ask me about gliders, the fascinating yet frustrating world of glider data, or living abroad!
* :snake: I enjoy coding, though I'm far from a pro—PR tests catch my mistakes, but at least I’ve reached the point where I need them!
* :de: Currently based in Hamburg! Come say hi!
* :email: Email me at chiara.monforte@uni-hamburg.de
